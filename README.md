Some coding exercises I practiced to teach myself Algorithms & Data Structures.  
This is only a SMALL part of it, the rest comes from books, videos, projects, online coding competitions, etc. Hours of work.

All of this info is available online. (Probably better explained too!)

// Edit:  
Commentaries are written in a more personal manner (because I didn't originally plan to put this up) so I apologize in advance.  
The solutions all work, so you should try to solve it yourself.  
Feel free to console.log() the steps, though.
