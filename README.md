Some coding exercises I practice to teach myself Algorithms & Data Structures.  
This is only a SMALL part of it, the rest comes from books, videos, projects, online coding challenges, etc. Hours of work.

All of this info is available online.

# Challenges section should be attempted on your own first. The goal is to sharpen your problem-solving skills.

// Edit:  
Commentaries are written in a more personal manner (because I didn't originally plan to put this up) so I apologize in advance. The solutions all work, so you should try to solve it yourself.
